Possibly also compatible with firefox (may require additional userchrome - feel free to make a PR to substitute Waterfox UI options if necessary!)

Requires the wonderful TreeStyleTab extension.

In Waterfox's Look and Feel section, the relevant options I have enabled are:

### Nav Bar
- Center Nav Bar Text

### Sidebar
- Auto Hide Sidebar
- Hide Sidebar Header (this *should* be implemented in my TST css for Firefox users, but no promises)

Please forgive this likely not being well scaled on different resolutions (I'm at 1080p) and any possibly poorly-performing CSS. This is basically how I learned CSS.
