Possibly also compatible with firefox (may require additional userchrome - feel free to make a PR to substitute Waterfox UI options if necessary!). If you give this a shot on Firefox, please let me know if it works for you!

Requires the wonderful TreeStyleTab extension.

In Waterfox's Look and Feel section, the relevant options I have enabled are:

### Nav Bar
- [x] Center Nav Bar Text

### Sidebar
- [x] Auto Hide Sidebar
- [x] Hide Sidebar Header (this *should* be implemented in my TST css for Firefox users, but no promises)

Please forgive this likely not being well scaled on different resolutions (I'm at 1080p) and any possibly poorly-performing CSS. This is basically how I learned CSS and so far I have been too lazy to not use pixel values or optimize thoroughly. It suits my needs atm and it was not made with others in mind. I'm happy to accept PRs though! Or maybe I'll fix it myself in the future.

Thanks a million to all the people of the firefox community who have indirectly helped me make this with their code and tips.
